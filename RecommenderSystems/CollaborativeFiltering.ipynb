    "Recommender systems are one of the most successful and widespread application of machine learning technologies in industry. The ability to suggest products with most appealing factor to each consumer type of your clients base is trivial not only to keep your clients engaged, but to atract new clients and expand your business. The business model and success of big companys like Netflix, Amazon, Steam, Spotify, YouTube and many others, revolves around the potency of their *Recommender Systems*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommender system deals with the task of predict the degree of similarity between items or users in a database. Based on these similarities that system can provide personalized *recommendations* of items (movies, songs, clothing, shoes, etc) for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, recommender systems can be classified into 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collaborative Filtering based:** These systems predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item based on past ratings or preferences. No item metadata is required, in contrast to its content-based counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content-based Filtering:** These systems predict the item rating or user preference based on item metadata (genre, director, description, actors, color, etc) and user preferences and history. These systems dependes highly on item metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hybrid systems:** These systems try to laverage the best of both worlds and contitutes a wide range of state-of-art techniques in industry. These are complex systems, usually made of multiple smaller subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those system types have their own pros and cons. In this post we'll implement a simple Collaborative Filtering based system."

    "# Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "As said before, Collabortative Filtering (CF) is a type of recommendation technique that uses similarities between users (or items) to infer the possible level of interest of a user to a item unrated by him. These similarities are computed using sonenly existing user ratings for items, so specific item description metadata is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general CF approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User-based**: which exploits similarities between **users**. A rating prediction of an user to an item is computed using ratings given similar users to the item.\n",
    "* **Item-based**: which exploits similarities between **items**. A rating prediction of an user to an item is computed using ratings of similar items.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the first step to build the system is to compute an **interactions matrix**, where each row contains the ratings given by a user to all items in database, as shown in example below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **interactions matrix** is, naturally, an *spase matrix*: in practical scenarios, the majority of the users may not have rated the majority of the items. This may lead to adoption of specific algorithms to deal with sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main algorithm types are used to implement recommender systems (either item or user based):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory based**, in which statistical techniques are applied to the entire dataset to calculate the rating predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model based**, which involve a stop to reduce or compress the large, but sparse, **interactions matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll use a *memory based* strategy, which is simpler to explain and easier to understand. In the next post we'll cover the implementation of a *model based* approach."
